* Synopsis
This small app allows you to create and organize tasks.
Each task has a content text or name associated to it, as well as a degree of importance.

You can also add deadlines and schedule dates.

On the homepage, you can add a new task and see all that you added. By clicking on a specific task, you can see detailed information about it and delete it.

On the 'Agenda' page, you can see tasks for which the deadline is in three days or less, as well as the tasks you scheduled for the day.
